# iPhone_purchase_predict
# Case:
Suppose that a survey is conducted in a mobile store where we collect information about the 
customers who buy iPhone and who do not buy an iPhone. This information is our dataset. The 
ultimate intent of this project is to build classifier models which predict if a customer who walks into 
the store will buy an iPhone or not.

In this project, I have built 7 different types of classifier models namely Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 
K- Nearest Neighbors, Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and 
XGBoost. To evaluate these models, I have used 2 different types of evaluation metrics namely, 
Accuracy Score and Confusion Matrix.

# Steps involved
The following are the steps involved:
1. Importing the data. 
  This is a crucial step. After successfully importing the data, we can import the libraries
  whenever necessary
2. Convert Gender to number. 
  Since this project involves dealing with customers who are either male of female, therefore 
  we have to convert the data. Gender is a categorical variable which we have to convert to 
  numerical variable
3. Feature selection and data split
4. Building seven types of classification models
5. Evaluating the built classification models using the evaluation metrics
